**Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**

This Python-based image encryption and decryption tool efficiently handles both encryption and decryption of images using a key-based transformation. It was developed to provide a secure method for processing image files.

### Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Easily encrypt or decrypt images using a mathematical transformation based on a user-provided key.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows users to specify an encryption or decryption key for enhanced control.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts users for input and provides feedback to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.
  
### How It Works
1. **Action Selection**: Choose whether to encrypt, decrypt, or quit.
2. **Image Input**: Enter the image file path for encryption or decryption.
3. **Key Input**: Enter a numerical key to perform the encryption or decryption.
4. **Processing**: The program performs the encryption or decryption based on the provided key.
5. **Output**: Displays the result of the encryption or decryption and saves the processed image.

### Usage
To use the tool, simply run the script, follow the prompts to enter your image path and key, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the image.

```bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
```
