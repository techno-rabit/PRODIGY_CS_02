**Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**

This Python-based image encryption and decryption tool efficiently handles both encryption and decryption of images using a key-based transformation. It was developed to provide a secure method for processing image files.

### Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Easily encrypt or decrypt images using a mathematical transformation based on a user-provided key.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows users to specify an encryption or decryption key for enhanced control over the process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts users for input and provides feedback to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.
- **Key Storage**: Saves the encryption key to a file for later use during decryption, enhancing security and usability.

### How It Works
1. **Action Selection**: The user is prompted to choose whether to encrypt, decrypt, or quit the program.
2. **Image Input**: The user enters the image file path for encryption or decryption.
3. **Key Input**: A numerical key is requested from the user, which will be used for the encryption or decryption process.
4. **Processing**: The program applies an XOR transformation using the provided key to encrypt or decrypt the image.
5. **Output**: The processed image is saved, and feedback is provided to the user regarding the success of the operation.

### Usage
To use the tool, simply run the script, follow the prompts to enter your image path and key, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the image.

Ensure you have installed Pillow for image manipulation:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
```bash
python iedrab.py
```
