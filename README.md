**Image Encryption and Decryption Tool**

This Python-based image encryption and decryption tool efficiently handles both encryption and decryption of images using a key-based transformation. It was developed to provide a secure method for processing image files.

### Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Easily encrypt or decrypt images using a mathematical transformation based on a user-provided key.
- **Customizable Input**: Allows users to specify an encryption or decryption key for enhanced control.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Prompts users for input and provides feedback to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.
  
### How It Works
1. **Action Selection**: Choose whether to encrypt, decrypt, or quit.
2. **Image Input**: Enter the image file path for encryption or decryption.
3. **Key Input**: Enter a numerical key to perform the encryption or decryption.
4. **Processing**: The program performs the encryption or decryption based on the provided key.
5. **Output**: Displays the result of the encryption or decryption and saves the processed image.

### Usage
To use the tool, simply run the script, follow the prompts to enter your image path and key, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the image.

Ensure you have installed Pillow for image manipulation:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
Run:
```bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
```
